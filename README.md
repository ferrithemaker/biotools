The whole *biotools* project has three different node-red modules:

- node-red-contrib-biotools: data input / output and parsing.
- node-red-contrib-biotools-sequence: sequence management.
- node-red-contrib-biotools-analysis: genomic sequence analysis.

Functionalities:

- RAW sequence preprocessing. (node-red-contrib-biotools package)
- FASTA file reading, writing and parsing. (node-red-contrib-biotools package)
- JASPAR PFM file reading and parsing. (node-red-contrib-biotools package)
- Genbank file reading and parsing. (node-red-contrib-biotools package)
